# Chromium Release Tracker

This repository provides always up-to-date download links for the latest **snapshot** Chromium browser builds for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Overview

An automated pipeline fetches the newest Chromium browser snapshots.

If a new Chromium snapshot is detected, the pipeline automatically creates a new release with updated download links.

The download links are collected and made available in a structured JSON file for easy integration or manual download.

**Note:** These are not stable releases, but the latest development snapshots directly from the Chromium build infrastructure.
